# Project Description 

# ðŸš– Uber_ML&DataAnalysis

This project provides an in-depth data analysis and machine learning modeling of Uber rides data. The goal is to uncover insights into customer behavior, driver performance, and revenue patterns while applying predictive models to support decision-making.

# ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handled missing values, formatted dates, and standardized numerical and categorical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Ride cancellations (by drivers & customers).

Revenue distribution across different vehicle types.

Patterns in demand and supply.

Machine Learning Models: Applied classification and regression models to predict key metrics (e.g., ride cancellations, revenue performance).

Visual Dashboards: Designed charts and plots for better understanding of trends and KPIs.

# ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Python: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: Classification & Regression Models

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (and optionally Power BI for dashboards)

# âœ… Outcomes

Identified cancellation trends by drivers vs customers.

Analyzed revenue performance against targets, minimum, and maximum values.

Built a foundation for predictive analytics to enhance Uberâ€™s operational efficiency.
